# Premier League Match Prediction

This project predicts Premier League match results and optimizes for a weekly prediction game scoring system:
- **4 points** — exact score correct  
- **3 points** — correct outcome + correct goal difference  
- **2 points** — correct outcome only  
- **0 points** — otherwise  

The goal is to build:
1. A **simple baseline model** (Poisson regression)
2. **More advanced ML models** with additional features
3. A comparison of their performance based on the custom scoring system
